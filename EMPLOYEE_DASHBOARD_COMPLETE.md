# Employee Dashboard with Coupon System - DEPLOYED ‚úÖ

## Status: Successfully Implemented and Deployed

The employee dashboard has been completely redesigned with an automatic coupon generation system, points tracking, and revenue tracking.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Coupon Generation**
- When an employee signs up, a unique coupon code is **automatically generated**
- Format: `EMP-XXXXXXXX` (8 random characters)
- Default discount: **20%**
- Code is displayed in an **animated box** with a subtle pulsing border effect

### 2. **Points System**
- Employees earn **1 point** for each successful signup using their coupon
- Points are tracked via the `usage_count` field in `employee_coupons` table
- Displayed in a clean card with icon

### 3. **Revenue Tracking**
- Employees earn **5% commission** on each paid subscription
- Commission is calculated automatically when a subscription is created with their coupon
- Total revenue is displayed in a dedicated card
- Individual commissions are tracked in the `commissions` table

### 4. **Clean Dashboard Layout**
- **3 main cards**: Coupon Code, Points, Revenue
- Animated coupon box with **copy button**
- Info section explaining how the system works
- No letter generation (subscriber-only feature)

## üìä Database Schema

### Tables Involved:

1. **employee_coupons**
   ```sql
   - id: UUID
   - employee_id: UUID (references profiles)
   - code: TEXT (unique, e.g., EMP-ABCD1234)
   - discount_percent: INTEGER (default: 20)
   - usage_count: INTEGER (points)
   - is_active: BOOLEAN
   ```

2. **commissions**
   ```sql
   - id: UUID
   - employee_id: UUID
   - subscription_id: UUID
   - commission_amount: NUMERIC(10,2) (5% of subscription price)
   - status: commission_status (pending/paid/cancelled)
   ```

3. **subscriptions**
   ```sql
   - coupon_code: TEXT
   - employee_id: UUID (set from coupon)
   - discount: NUMERIC(5,2)
   ```

## üîß Implementation Details

### 1. Updated Trigger: `handle_new_user()`

**Location**: [supabase/migrations/20251029114229_auto_generate_employee_coupon.sql](supabase/migrations/20251029114229_auto_generate_employee_coupon.sql)

**What it does**:
- Checks if the new user's role is 'employee'
- Generates a unique coupon code using MD5 hash
- Inserts the coupon into `employee_coupons` table
- Sets discount to 20% and activates the coupon

```sql
-- If employee, auto-generate coupon code
IF v_role = 'employee' THEN
  v_coupon_code := 'EMP-' || UPPER(SUBSTRING(MD5(NEW.id::TEXT || NOW()::TEXT) FROM 1 FOR 8));

  INSERT INTO public.employee_coupons (employee_id, code, discount_percent, is_active)
  VALUES (NEW.id, v_coupon_code, 20, TRUE);
END IF;
```

### 2. Existing Trigger: `handle_subscription_insert()`

**Already in place** - handles:
- Validating coupon code
- Creating commission record (5% of subscription price)
- Incrementing usage_count (points)
- Updating employee earnings
- Linking subscription to employee

### 3. Employee Dashboard Components

**Server Component**: [app/dashboard/employee/page.tsx](app/dashboard/employee/page.tsx)
- Fetches employee coupon data
- Calculates total points and revenue
- Passes data to client component

**Client Component**: [app/dashboard/employee/client.tsx](app/dashboard/employee/client.tsx)
- Animated coupon box with pulsing border
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Points and revenue display cards
- Responsive design

## üé® UI Features

### Animated Coupon Box:
- Gradient background (blue to indigo)
- Pulsing border animation
- Large, bold coupon code display
- Copy button with success feedback
- Discount percentage badge

### Stats Cards:
- **Points Card**: Green theme with checkmark icon
- **Revenue Card**: Purple theme with dollar icon
- Hover effects and smooth transitions

### Info Section:
- Blue background with explanatory text
- Clear bullet points on how to earn

## üìù How It Works

### For Employees:
1. **Sign up** as an employee (select "Employee" role during signup)
2. **Coupon is auto-generated** immediately
3. **Share coupon code** with potential subscribers
4. **Earn points** when someone signs up with your code (1 point per signup)
5. **Earn revenue** when they pay for a subscription (5% commission)
6. **Track everything** on your dashboard

### For Subscribers:
1. Sign up for an account
2. Enter employee's coupon code at checkout
3. Get **20% discount** on subscription
4. Employee earns a point and commission
