# Role Selection During Signup - DEPLOYED ✅

## Status: Successfully Deployed

The role selection feature has been fully implemented and deployed to production.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Frontend Changes ([app/auth/page.tsx](app/auth/page.tsx))
- **Line 14**: Added `role` state to track selected role
- **Lines 156-170**: Added dropdown UI with two options:
  - **"Client (seeking legal services)"** → assigns `user` role
  - **"Employee (providing legal services)"** → assigns `employee` role
- **Line 34**: Role is passed through signup metadata to the backend

### 2. Backend Changes
- **Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20251029110308_update_handle_new_user_role.sql`
- **Function Updated**: `handle_new_user()` trigger
- **Change**: Now reads role from `NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'role'` instead of hardcoding `'user'`
- **Fallback**: Defaults to `'user'` role if no role is specified

## How It Works

1. User visits `/auth` and clicks "Sign Up"
2. User fills in email, password, full name
3. User selects their role from dropdown:
   - **Client** → user role (default)
   - **Employee** → employee role
4. On signup, the role is saved to `raw_user_meta_data`
5. Database trigger `handle_new_user()` reads the role from metadata
6. User is created with the selected role in `user_roles` table

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Sign up as Client
1. Go to `/auth`
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Fill in details
4. Select "Client (seeking legal services)"
5. Submit form
6. Confirm email
7. User should be redirected to `/dashboard` with `user` role

### Test Case 2: Sign up as Employee
1. Go to `/auth`
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Fill in details
4. Select "Employee (providing legal services)"
5. Submit form
6. Confirm email
7. User should be redirected to `/dashboard/employee` with `employee` role

## Verification Queries

Check user roles in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- See all users and their roles
SELECT
  p.email,
  p.full_name,
  ur.role
FROM profiles p
JOIN user_roles ur ON p.id = ur.user_id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Files Modified

2. `supabase/DEPLOY_ALL.sql` - Updated function definition
3. `supabase/migrations/20251029110308_update_handle_new_user_role.sql` - New migration
