## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Audit Logs (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
node scripts/create-audit-logs.mjs
# Follow the instructions to apply SQL in Supabase Dashboard
```

### Step 2: Environment Variables
Ensure `.env.local` or production environment has:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://liepvjfiezgjrchbdwnb.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro
ADMIN_SIGNUP_SECRET=your-admin-secret
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret

# Optional for production payments
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

### Step 3: Build & Deploy
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify (using netlify.toml config)
netlify deploy --prod

# OR Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Setup
1. **Create First Admin User:**
   - Sign up via `/auth`
   - Use secret from `/admin/access` to verify admin status
   - Manually update user role in Supabase:
     ```sql
     UPDATE user_roles SET role = 'admin' WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
     ```

2. **Test All Three Roles:**
   - **Subscriber (user):** Can generate letters, view quota
   - **Employee:** Can create coupons, view commissions
   - **Admin:** Full system access, user management

3. **Configure Email Verification (Optional):**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Email Templates
   - Customize confirmation emails
   - Enable email verification in Auth settings

## 📊 Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables
1. **profiles** - User profiles (extends Supabase auth)
2. **user_roles** - RBAC (user, employee, admin)
3. **letters** - Generated legal letters
4. **subscriptions** - Subscription plans and status
5. **employee_coupons** - Referral codes
6. **commissions** - Employee earnings

### Enums
- `user_role`: user, employee, admin
- `letter_status`: generating, completed, failed
- `sub_status`: active, canceled, expired
- `commission_status`: pending, paid, cancelled

### Key Functions
- `is_admin()` - Check if user is admin
- `is_employee()` - Check if user is employee
- `check_subscription_limits()` - Validate letter quota
- `handle_subscription_insert()` - Auto-create commissions

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Recommendations

### Warnings (Non-Blocking)
- ESLint warnings about `useEffect` dependencies - safe to ignore
- Font override warnings for Geist fonts - cosmetic only
- Supabase Edge Runtime warnings - expected with middleware

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Stripe Integration:** Complete webhook implementation for real payments
2. **Email Verification:** Enable in Supabase Auth settings
3. **Error Monitoring:** Add Sentry or LogRocket
4. **Rate Limiting:** Consider Redis for production (currently in-memory)
5. **Audit Logs:** Apply the audit_logs table SQL for compliance

### Security Notes
- ✅ All sensitive operations protected by RLS
- ✅ Admin routes require admin role via middleware
- ✅ Service role key isolated to server-side operations
- ✅ No API keys exposed to client
- ✅ Constant-time string comparison for admin verification
