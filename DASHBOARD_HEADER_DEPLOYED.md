# Dashboard Header with Logout & Profile - DEPLOYED ✅

## Status: Successfully Deployed to Vercel

The dashboard header with logout button and profile settings has been implemented and deployed.

## What Was Added

### 1. New Component: DashboardHeader ([components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.tsx](components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.tsx))

Features:
- **User Avatar**: Circular avatar with first letter of user's name
- **Dropdown Menu**: Click avatar to open menu with options:
  - Profile Settings (links to `/dashboard/subscriber/profile`)
  - Logout (signs user out and redirects to `/auth`)
- **Responsive Design**: Shows full name on larger screens, avatar only on mobile
- **Loading State**: Shows "Logging out..." during logout process
- **Smooth Animations**: Rotating arrow icon and smooth transitions

### 2. Integration

The header has been added to:
- **Subscriber Dashboard** ([app/dashboard/subscriber/page.tsx](app/dashboard/subscriber/page.tsx))
- **Employee Dashboard** ([app/dashboard/employee/page.tsx](app/dashboard/employee/page.tsx))

## How It Works

1. **Header Display**:
   - Shows "Talk-To-My-Lawyer" branding on the left
   - User avatar with initials on the right
   - User name displayed on desktop screens

2. **Dropdown Menu**:
   - Click the avatar/name area to open menu
   - Click outside menu to close it
   - Two options available:
     - **Profile Settings**: Navigate to profile page
     - **Logout**: Sign out and return to auth page

3. **Logout Flow**:
   ```
   User clicks Logout
   → Button shows "Logging out..."
   → supabase.auth.signOut() called
   → Redirect to /auth page
   → Page refresh to clear session
   ```
